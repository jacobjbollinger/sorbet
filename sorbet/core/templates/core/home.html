                <h3>What Sorbet Is</h3>
                <p>Sorbet is a simple RSS feed fetcher/parser and sender, it
                    takes and RSS feed and sends it to your inbox whenever it
                    gets updated.</p>
                <h3>What Sorbet Isn't</h3>
                <p>A "feed reader" in the usual sense, you can setup the feeds
                    you want and check on their status but your email client
                    is technically your feed reader now.</p>

                <h3>Why Sorbet?</h3>
                <p>I've been all over the internets and have consumed enough
                    data. I have a very small selection of feeds I wish to read
                    on a regular basis and those feeds I <em>never</em> want to
                    miss a single post on. Most feed readers are built for quick
                    browsing massive amounts of feeds. My email is built so that
                    I am garenteed to see every email/post and read it. Why
                    reinvent the wheel, just sent them to something I already
                    use.</p>
