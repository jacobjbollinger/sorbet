## Helping Out

Check out the [issues page][1] on GitHub or the code itself, if you can help with
anything there it will be greatly appreciated and you'll be added to the list
of contributors! I won't add you for making a single spelling correction but if
you found 5 spelling mistakes or rewrote a whole paragraph or rewrote
the caching engine then you'll be added! You don't have to be a programmer to
help.
